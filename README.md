# RemindersSync

A Swift-based command-line tool that provides two-way synchronization between your Obsidian vault and Apple's Reminders app. It scans your vault for incomplete tasks and syncs them with Apple Reminders, while also maintaining a markdown export of your other reminders.

## Features

- **Two-Way Task Completion Sync**:
  - Tasks completed in Apple Reminders are marked as completed (`- [x]`) in Obsidian files
  - Completed tasks in Obsidian are not re-synced to Reminders
  - Maintains task completion state across both platforms

- **Vault to Reminders Sync**:
  - Scans your entire Obsidian vault for incomplete tasks (`- [ ]`)
  - Creates reminders with clickable links back to source files
  - Shows file names with link emoji (ðŸ”—) in reminder titles
  - Supports Obsidian-style due dates (ðŸ“… YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Uses proper Obsidian URI scheme for direct file opening
  - Prevents duplicate entries

- **Reminders to Vault Export**:
  - Exports all incomplete reminders to a markdown file
  - Organizes tasks by list
  - Preserves due dates and notes
  - Excludes specific lists (e.g., "Groceries", "Obsidian")

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- Xcode (for development)
- Access permissions to Apple Reminders

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd RemindersSync
```

2. Build the project using Swift Package Manager:
```bash
swift build
```

## System-wide Installation

To make the tool available system-wide:

1. Build a release version:
```bash
cd /path/to/RemindersSync
swift build -c release
```

2. Copy the executable to your local bin directory:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo cp .build/release/SwiftRemindersCLI /usr/local/bin/obsidian-reminders
```

3. Make it executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/obsidian-reminders
```

Now you can run the tool from anywhere using:
```bash
obsidian-reminders ~/path/to/vault
```

### Optional: Create an Alias

Add this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
alias sync-obsidian='obsidian-reminders "/Users/your-username/path/to/your/vault"'
```

Then you can simply run:
```bash
sync-obsidian
```

Remember to run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bashrc`) after adding the alias.

## Usage

Run the tool with your Obsidian vault path:
```bash
swift run SwiftRemindersCLI <path-to-obsidian-vault>
```

Example:
```bash
swift run SwiftRemindersCLI ~/Documents/MyVault
```

### Task Format

The tool recognizes:
- Incomplete tasks: `- [ ] Task description`
- Complete tasks: `- [x] Task description`
- Due dates: `- [ ] Task description ðŸ“… 2024-12-22`

### Output

1. **In Apple Reminders**:
   - Tasks appear as: "Task description ðŸ”— filename.md"
   - Each reminder includes:
     - Clickable Obsidian link in notes
     - Due date (if specified)
     - Source file reference
   - Completing a task in Reminders will mark it as completed in Obsidian

2. **In Obsidian**:
   - Tasks completed in Reminders are marked with `- [x]`
   - Creates `_AppleReminders.md` in your vault
   - Organizes tasks by reminder list
   - Includes due dates and notes

### Excluded Lists

The following reminder lists are excluded from export:
- Obsidian
- Groceries
- Shopping
- Cooking-HouseHold

## Configuration

By default, the tool:
- Scans all markdown files in your vault for tasks
- Syncs found tasks to a Reminders list named "Obsidian"
- Exports other reminders to `_AppleReminders.md` in your vault root

## Permissions

The app requires permission to access your Reminders. You'll be prompted for this permission when running the tool for the first time. To manage permissions:
1. Go to System Preferences
2. Navigate to Privacy & Security â†’ Reminders
3. Ensure RemindersSync is allowed access
